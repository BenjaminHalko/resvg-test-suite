== About

This page contains results of the https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg-test-suite[resvg test suite]
which is specifically designed for the https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg[resvg] library.

=== What we do not test

* Features that isn't yet implemented in the _resvg_.
* XML parsing. Except some DTD and namespace resolving we assume that SVG library supports full XML 1.0 spec.
* Extended CSS support.
* Extended raster image formats features. We assume that underlying PNG and JPEG libraries are good.
* Pointer events.
* Animations.
* Scripting.

== Additional notes

// TODO: add shaping image


* _batik_ doesn't support anti-aliasing during `clipPath`, but we are ignoring this.
* _batik_ doesn't support text shaping,
  so characters will be aligned incorrectly, but we are ignoring this because otherwise we have to
  mark all text-based test as failed, which is not fair.
* All libraries are rendering text a bit different. We do not treat this as an error.
* Some tests are marked as UB (undefined behavior). This means that I don't know how the correct
  result should look like. Usually, all libraries will render those files differently.
  Those tests are marked as *Unknown*, but they must not crash anyway.
* Every application and library are rendering the basic shapes a bit differently.
  We do not treat this as an error.
